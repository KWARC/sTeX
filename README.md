sTeX: An Infrastructure for Semantic Preloading of LaTeX Documents
====

This repository contains the sTeX package collection, a version of TeX/LaTeX that allows
to markup TeX/LaTeX documents semantically without leaving the document format,
essentially turning it into a document format for mathematical knowledge management (MKM).

See the
[documentation of the sTeX packgae](https://github.com/KWARC/sTeX/blob/master/sty/core/stex/stex.pdf)
for details.

sTeX documents can be transformed to [OMDoc](http://omdoc.org) via the
[sTeX Plugin](https://github.com/KWARC/LaTeXML-Plugin-sTeX/) for
[LaTeXML](https://github.com/brucemiller/LaTeXML) available at
https://github.com/KWARC/LaTeXML-Plugin-sTeX/.
